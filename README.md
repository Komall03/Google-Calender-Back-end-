Google Calender Back end 
To implement Google Calendar integration using Django Rest API and OAuth2 mechanism, we can define the following API endpoints and their corresponding views:

Endpoint: /rest/v1/calendar/init/

View: GoogleCalendarInitView
Description: Initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting the user to Google's OAuth consent screen to authorize calendar access.
Flow:
Generate the authorization URL using the Google API credentials.
Redirect the user to the authorization URL.
Endpoint: /rest/v1/calendar/redirect/

View: GoogleCalendarRedirectView
Description: Handles the redirect request from Google's OAuth consent screen and retrieves the access token.
Flow:
Retrieve the authorization code from the request.
Exchange the authorization code for an access token using the Google API credentials.
Store the access token securely (e.g., in the user's session or database).
Retrieve the list of events from the user's calendar using the obtained access token.


 This is a basic implementation to demonstrate the flow.
